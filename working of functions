Class calcs
This class encapsulates various mathematical operations that can be performed on a single floating-point value.

Function isOperator
Checks if a given character is a recognized operator.

bool isOperator(char a): Returns true if the character a is one of the operators (+-*/^aqcstCSTliL), otherwise returns false.

Function doCalculus
Performs calculations based on the given numbers and operators.

float doCalculus(vector <float> numbers, vector <char> operators): Initializes a calcs object with the first number. Then iterates through the operators, applying the corresponding mathematical operation to the calcs object. The final result is returned as a float.

Function help
Displays a help message showing the usage of the calculator.

void help(): Clears the screen and prints a help sheet with explanations of the operators and special functions available.

Main Function
The entry point of the program that handles user input and processes calculations.

int main(): Initializes a console title, enters a loop to continuously accept user input, and performs the following tasks:

Prompts the user for input.
Checks if the input is a request for help (h).
Parses the input string to separate numbers and operators.
Handles special cases for P (Ï€) and E (e).
Calls doCalculus to compute the result and displays it.
Pauses and clears the screen for the next calculation.
